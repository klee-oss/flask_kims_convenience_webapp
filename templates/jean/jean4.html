<h1> Nice job sharing your sentiments and wanting to maintain the authenticity of the show. Unfortunately, the producers do not want to engage with you nor the rest of the Asian cast's ideas or opinions. 
In fact, you only receive your script 1.5 weeks before shooting so nevermind the asks to write or direct any episodes. Now they are hoping to diagnose Umma with multiple sclerosis, what will you do? </h1>
